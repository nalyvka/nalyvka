- 🔭 I’m currently working on completing the TOP curriculum & my pinned Python repos.
- 🌱 Self-learning real/complex analysis (disillusioned with the current pacing of my uni courses), PCB design, and 3D printing (with Fusion360) for prototyping mechanical builds so I can actually integrate my circuit designs into something portable
- 📫 How to reach me: @nalyvka on Discord (feel free to send me a friend request or dm) and my public email address is: nalyvka@pm.me
Fun fact: I like designing 3D figurines using blender
