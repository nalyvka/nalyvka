- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on completing the TOP curriculum & my pinned Python repos.
- ðŸŒ± Self-learning real/complex analysis (disillusioned with the current pacing of my uni courses), PCB design, and 3D printing (with Fusion360) for prototyping mechanical builds so I can actually integrate my circuit designs into something portable
